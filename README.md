[Download GPDL program](https://github.com/cakama3a/GPDL/tree/StickTest/dist) for Windows 10/11  
[Arduino code](https://github.com/cakama3a/GPDL/blob/StickTest/Arduino.ino) this code should be flashed to the Arduino via [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)  
[Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epm2li1hrK8), the Arduino circuit in the video is a bit outdated, but the principle is the same  

**ACTUAL SCHEME**  
The current GPDL tester scheme for version 2.2.5 and higher. The diagram shows an Arduino Micro, because I couldn't find a picture of a Nano.

**ABOUT GPDL**  
The gamepadla project was created to test the latency of game controllers. It is open-source and allows any enthusiast to measure gamepad latency with the tools at hand in an Arduino-based device.
